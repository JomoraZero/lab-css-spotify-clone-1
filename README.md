All of the necessary assets and images are included in the starter code.

## Exercise

#### Requirements

- [Fork this repo](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/)
- Clone this repo into your `~/code/labs`
- You must use 1 descendant selector, and 1 multi selector. You can use more.
- Animate the green Spotify logo in the upper left-hand corner to jump up and down when a user hovers over it.

#### Starter code

The starter-code contains all the files, images, and text content needed to create the page. The text is in the `index.html`, and a css file is created in `main.css` with colors.
